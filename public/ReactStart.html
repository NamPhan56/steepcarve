                - These are the basic steps for starting a React Web App including Github Repository setup

                ---
                
                ## Setup Local Directory
                1. Locate a directory to setup your app
                2. Create your app folder, use the foldername: "reactapp" for this example
                3. Open VS Code and navigate to your new reactapp directory
                4. Initiate node with `npm init`
                
                ## Setup Github Repository
                1. Install [Github Deskop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
                    - Note: Github Desktop is optional, but makes pushing easier
                2. In VS Code, navigate into "reactapp" folder
                3. Initiate Git: `git init`
                4. Make a .gitignore file and add `node_modules` to it
                5. Open Github Desktop > "File" > "Add Local Repository" > and type in the directory of "reactapp"
                6. Use Github Desktop to push to your repository.
                    - Note: this assumes you are already signed in using your github account

                ## Install Express
                1. In VS Code and in the "reactapp" directory, use command: `npm i express`

                ## Install and setup nodemon
                1. In VS Code and in the "reactapp" directory, use command: `npm i nodemon -D"
                    - "-D" will set the dependency as "Developer"
